OVERVIEW
///////////////////////////

- I adhered as close to the google doc reference as I could for this design.

- mobile and desktop versions of app 

- 6 pages of this application

- I decided to use the colors from the logo for the theme colors. 

- This project ultilizes industry best tools for enhanced speed and optimization

- This is a full stack application, which means that there is a frontend and backend operating
There is an emailing API I set up along with the custom email UI. I will show you the sample email
and you can have it styled as is best for you or whoever is going to be viewing such emails.
This emailing api allows us to ensure encryption in cross traffic of emails, a customizable UI for the recipient, and a consistent way to validate form submissions

- I would have to research to find what the best hosting platform is for this site. Some I know about are Heroku, Glitch, AWS, Azure, Render, and Vercel

- 3 areas for navigation
Mobile navigation
Desktop navigation
Footer navigation


///////////////////////////
STAFF CARDS
///////////////////////////

- consistent background for staff pictures 
- circles instead of rect
- dave and sally on side 
- office heiarchy 
- possibly remove pictures from staff card and include only email, name, and title 
- accordian menu separated by title 

///////////////////////////
SDRC
///////////////////////////
- Buttons
- container or strip with different color 
- if it is too hard find another way to use thelink like styled text 
- emphasizes the 
///////////////////////////
FONT

- Montserrat
- colors
- Script rarely used 

///////////////////////////
LANDING PAGE
///////////////////////////
- style for landing page
- shortened mission statement
- possibly shorten my story


///////////////////////////
TEESTIMONIAL
///////////////////////////
add big quotes 

- could use other branding materials like APOG in circle 
///////////////////////////
CAREERS
///////////////////////////
- change text to job opportunities
- current job openings
///////////////////////////
THINGS NEEDED
///////////////////////////

1. Structure of home page 
- we have a lot more text than the reference home page, thus making the image and composition look off 
- I have some examples of hero images we can look at,
- personally, I think a large horizontal image with the "Our Story" Text, followed by the paragraphs underneath the hero image could look better 

2. Font Styles
- a good place to look is google fonts to ensure that exact font can be used 

3. Production Images
- HD 
- Having proper ratios for certain screen widths
- 16:9, 1:1, 8:11.5
4. Preferred Buttons and their Style 

///////////////////////////
OUR MISSION
///////////////////////////

///////////////////////////
PRACTICAL CHANGES I THINK SHOULD STAY
///////////////////////////

1. Job application form opening in new tab instead of inside the webpage 
- if we did not do that then it will mess up the UI, could cause security issues, and is not very pleasant for the UX



///////////////////////////
OTHER FEATURES THAT COULD BE ADDED
///////////////////////////

1. Individual staff bios accessable by clicking on their card 
2. directing form submission emails to multiple email accounts 
3. Page showing good conditions of some of the homes or events
4. Detailed focus on SEO and website searchability

///////////////////////////
THINGS LEFT TO DO
///////////////////////////

1. decide on a platform to host (frontend and backend)
2. ! find out where original code is hosted and see if we need to buy a new domain or if we could use the existing one 
3. test for all device compatibility with newer features 
4. Decide what is most important in the site and have discussions about alternatives for certain browsers when nearing launch

PHOTOS
///////////////////////////

- set rules for picture submissions
